    "As you examine the lake, you notice that a particular oddity manifests. From an aerial view, the lake shore looks smooth like a curve. However, as you zoom in and take a closer look you notice that the lake shore has ridges and nooks. If you walk around the lake, you see that the ridges and nooks have smaller ridges and nooks of their own\n",

    "If time were not an issue one suggestion would be to find as many diameters as possible and create a statistical spread, the true diameter must lie somewhere between the largest and the smallest. This would allow you to understand how many diameters fall closer to the largest,smallest, median etc. and see where the true diameter will most likely lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option would be to count all the large and small rideges and set a benchmark for a ridge size that you will take into account when measuring diameter, maybe based on the depth of water around that ridge, larger ones will have encapsulated more water "

    "I know there are mathematical tools called \"smoothers\" that allow you to describe complex curves with simplified, \"smoothed-out\" versions of the function...\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since the ridges are often very small and irregular about the perimeter, including their distance in the diameter to estimate the perimeter of the whole would be inaccuate. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However instead, we could use smoothers such as [Bézier_curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Higher-order_curves) to create estimations from the ridges and use the apex of those curves as points to measure the diameter from, this way you are accounting for the presence of the ridge without giving it too much importance.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This, combined with my original suggestion to take multiple diameter measurements should create a decent approximation."
